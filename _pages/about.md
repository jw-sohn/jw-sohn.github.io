I am a Master's student in Computer Science and Engineering at Korea University, advised by [Prof. Jaewoo Kang](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=RaBZafQAAAAJ&hl=ko). My research interests lie in natural language processing (NLP), with a focus on medical applications, large language models (LLMs), and information retrieval (IR).

Currently, I am a research intern at [Yale University's Gerstein Lab](https://www.gersteinlab.org/), working on medical multi-agent systems for clinical decision support under the guidance of [Prof. Mark Gerstein](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YvjuUugAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Xiangru Tang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=gGcRkpYAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also collaborating with [Prof. Qingyu Chen's Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/qingyuchen/home/) at Yale on systematic validation of medical retrieval-augmented generation systems.

Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degrees in Health and Environmental Science and Artificial Intelligence at Korea University. During my undergraduate studies, I worked on various NLP projects including phenotype named entity recognition and normalization as part of the BioCreative VIII challenge.
