Hello! Welcome to my page ðŸ‘‹

I am an incoming PhD student at ETH Zurich (starting May 1st). 

Previously, I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Korea University in February, where I was advised by [Prof. Jaewoo Kang](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=RaBZafQAAAAJ&hl=ko) at the [DMIS Lab](https://dmis.korea.ac.kr). My research interests lie in natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs), information retrieval (IR), and agents.

I collaborate with Yale University's [Gerstein Lab](https://www.gersteinlab.org/), working on medical multi-agent systems for clinical decision support under the guidance of [Prof. Mark Gerstein](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YvjuUugAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Xiangru Tang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=gGcRkpYAAAAJ&hl=en).

I also collaborate with Yale University's [Qingyu Chen's Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/qingyuchen/home/), working on systematic validation of medical retrieval-augmented generation systems under the guidance of [Prof. Qingyu Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/qingyuchen/home/) and [Dr. Hyunjae Kim](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=rqBpumIAAAAJ&hl=en).

You can find my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ylIhycQhHHcpu64H05w4wYu58qo3JjST/view?usp=sharing).

## Research Interests
My research focuses on:

Information Retrieval [NAACL'25, ISMB'24]
- Novel dense retrieval architectures
- Knowledge grounding
- Factual verification 

Multi-Agent Systems
- Process-level reward modeling
- Agentic retrieval-augmented generation
- Optimization of agent workflows
