Hello! Welcome to my page ðŸ‘‹

I am a Master's student in Computer Science and Engineering at Korea University, advised by [Prof. Jaewoo Kang](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=RaBZafQAAAAJ&hl=ko). My research interests lie in natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs), information retrieval (IR), and agents.

Currently, 
I am a research assistant at [Yale University's Gerstein Lab](https://www.gersteinlab.org/), working on medical multi-agent systems for clinical decision support under the guidance of [Prof. Mark Gerstein](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YvjuUugAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Xiangru Tang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=gGcRkpYAAAAJ&hl=en). 
I am also a research assistant at [Yale University's Gerstein Lab](https://www.gersteinlab.org/), working on systematic validation of medical retrieval-augmented generation systems under the guidance of [Prof. Qingyu Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/qingyuchen/home/) and [Hyunjae Kim](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=rqBpumIAAAAJ&hl=en).

<br>

## Research Interests
My research focuses on:

Information Retrieval [NAACL'25, ISMB'24]
- Novel architectures beyond bi-encoders for targeted retrieval, with a focus on late interaction
- Retrieval enhancing knowledge grounding and factual verification 

Multi-Agent Systems
- Process-level reward modeling for explainable and verifiable reasoning
- Agentic retrieval-augmented generation for clinical decision support
- Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to design optimal agent workflows

Large Language Models
- Developed the first 7B parameter open-source medical language model capable of passing the USMLE, runnable on personal computers, bridging
