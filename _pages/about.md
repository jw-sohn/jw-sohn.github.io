Hello! Welcome to my page ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student at ETH ZÃ¼rich, advised by [Prof. Michael Moor](https://michaelmoor.me/) at the [Medical AI Lab](https://bsse.ethz.ch/mail).

Previously, I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Korea University in February, where I was advised by [Prof. Jaewoo Kang](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=RaBZafQAAAAJ&hl=ko) at the [DMIS Lab](https://dmis.korea.ac.kr). 

My research interests lie in natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs), information retrieval (IR), and medical artificial intelligence (MAI).

You can find my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ylIhycQhHHcpu64H05w4wYu58qo3JjST/view?usp=sharing), and [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5cUeXqIAAAAJ&hl=en).
