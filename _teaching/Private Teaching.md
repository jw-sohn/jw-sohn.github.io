I have extensive experience as a private tutor and instructor at multiple academies since 2016. My teaching focuses on STEM subjects including mathematics, physics, and chemistry at both high school and college preparatory levels. Through individualized instruction and mentoring, I help students build strong conceptual foundations while developing problem-solving skills. I also provide guidance on university admissions, helping students prepare competitive applications for top engineering and science programs.
