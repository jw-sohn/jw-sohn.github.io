I have been working as a private tutor and instructor at various private academies since 2016, teaching mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Through personalized instruction and mentoring, I help students develop strong foundations in STEM subjects and achieve their academic goals. My teaching experience spans from high school to university level coursework, with a focus on helping students master complex scientific concepts and problem-solving skills.
